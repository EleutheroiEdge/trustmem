# Project Canonical Memory

## Decisions
- Use distilled memory over raw transcript storage by default.

## Preferences
- Keep all secrets in environment variables and never in tracked files.

## Constraints
- Do not persist credentials in memory artifacts.

## Open TODOs
- Add source-specific retrieval quality checks.
